      <h2 id="disputes">15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
      <h3>Binding Arbitration</h3>
      <p>
        Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Legal Terms,
        including any question regarding its existence, validity, or
        termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the
        International Commercial Arbitration Court under the European
        Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146) according to
        the Rules of this ICAC, which, as a result of referring to it, is
        considered as the part of this clause. The number of arbitrators shall
        be one (1). The seat, or legal place, or arbitration shall be Rosario,
        Argentina. The language of the proceedings shall be Spanish. The
        governing law of these Legal Terms shall be substantive law of
        Argentina.
      </p>
      <h3>Restrictions</h3>
      <p>
        The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
        between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law,
        (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there
        is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
        class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there
        is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
        representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other
        persons.
      </p>
      <h3>Exceptions to Arbitration</h3>
      <p>
        The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
        above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes
        seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the
        intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or
        arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or
        unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this
        provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party
        will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
        provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be
        decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed
        for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
        jurisdiction of that court.
